<p>Predicting the results of sports is a big deal for many people, ranging from casual fans to analysts and sports franchises. Accurately predicting the scores and outcomes of matches not only is important to fans but also to organizers to create fair leagues. The purpose of this project is to implement various neural network approaches in accurately predicting soccer scores in the English Premier League and testing their accuracy.</p>

<a id="problem-description" class="anchor" href="#problem-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Description</h3>

<p>Soccer is a highly competitive sport with many factors affecting each game. Given a team dataset, successfully implement and compare different neural networks to accurately predict soccer scores and outcomes using past matches for the EPL and additional features.</p>

<p>In the sample data set given, the values of division, Home Team, Away Team, FTHG, FTAG, HS, AS (which are acronyms for different soccer statistics like Full-Time Home Goals, Home shots, etc.) are read into a dictionary. This makes it easier to access a value with some key and extracting the value given the key for the data set.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
